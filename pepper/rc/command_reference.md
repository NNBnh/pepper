These are builtin commands that can be used to interact with the editor
besides its main code editing features.
Keep in mind that some of these commands are intended for interactive use
and some others for use in configuration files.

Commands have the form:
`[%<register-key> =] <command-name> [<flags...>] [<arguments...>]`

Where `<register-key>` is a lowercase letter (`[a-z]`), and `<flags>` and `<arguments>` depend on each command.

Also, when passing literal text values, you can pass them between `"`, `'` or `{` and `}`.
The latter being, correctly balanced. So writing `command { some { random } text }` will pass
` some { random } text ` as a single argument to `command`.

### registers

register key | about
--- | ---
`a` | Auto macro register. It contains the recorded keys from the last selection+edit action in normal mode
`s` | Search register. It contains the pattern of the last search performed. Setting it will perform a new search the next time you try to move to next search result
`z` | Return register. It's a convention when writing pepper macros that this register is used when passing single values around (like all builtin commands with callbacks).

**NOTE**: when you record a macro, the recorded keys will be stored on the register of the key you press after `q`.

# builtin commands

## `help`
Searches the help pages for `<keyword>`.
If `<keyword>` is not present, opens the main help page.
- alias: `h`
- usage: `help [<keyword>]`

## `try`
Try executing commands without propagating errors.
Then optionally executes commands if there was an error.
- usage: `try { <commands...> } [catch { <commands...> }]`

## `macro`
Defines a new macro command.
A `<param-register>` should be the register name that will contain the arg value.
- usage: `macro [<flags>] <name> <param-registers...> { <commands> }`
- flags:
  - `-hidden` : whether this command is shown in completions or not

## `request`
Register a request command for this client.
The client needs to implement the editor protocol.
Because of that, it only makes sense to use this if it's called from a custom client.
- usage: `request [<flags>] <name>`
- flags:
  - `-hidden` : whether this command is shown in completions or not

## `copy-command`
Sets the command to be used when copying text to clipboard.
The copied text is written to stdin utf8 encoded.
This is most useful on platforms that do not have an unique way to interact with the clipboard.
If `<command>` is empty, no command is used.
- usage: `copy-command <command>`

## `paste-command`
Sets the command to be used when pasting text from clipboard.
The pasted text is read from stdout and needs to be utf8 encoded.
This is most useful on platforms that do not have an unique way to interact with the clipboard.
If `<command>` is empty, no command is used.
- usage: `paste-command <command>`

## `spawn`
Spawns a new process and then optionally executes commands on its output.
Those commands will be executed on every splitted output if `-split-on-byte` is set
or on its etirety when the process exits otherwise.
Output can be accessed from the `%z` register in `<commands-on-output>`
- usage: `spawn [<flags>] <spawn-command> [<commands-on-output...>]`
- flags:
  - `-input=<text>` : sends `<text>` to the stdin
  - `-env=<vars>` : sets environment variables in the form `VAR=<value> VAR=<value>...`
  - `-split-on-byte=<number>` : splits process output at every <number> byte

## `replace-with`

each cursor selection will be used as a delete range. Then, it inserts `<text>` at every delete range,
effectivelly replacing its previous contents.
- usage: `replace-with [<flags>] <text>`
- flags:
  - `-buffer=<buffer-id>` : if present, buffer with id `<buffer-id>` is used instead
  - `-from=<position>` : if present, replace range will start at `<position>`
  - `-to=<position>` : if present, replace range will end at `<position>`

Executes keys as if they were inputted manually.
- usage: `execute-keys <keys>`
- flags:
  - `-client=<client-id>` : send keys on behalf of client `<client-id>`

The line read can be accessed from the `%z` register in `<commands>`.
- usage: `read-line [<flags>] <commands...>`
- flags:
  - `-prompt=<prompt-text>` : the prompt text that shows just before user input (default: `read-line:`)

## `pick`
Opens up a menu from where an option can be picked and then executes commands.
Options can be added with the `add-picker-option` command.
The picked entry can be accessed from the `%z` register in `<commands>`.
- usage: `pick [<flags>] <commands>`
- flags:
  - `-prompt=<prompt-text>` : the prompt text that shows just before user input (default: `pick:`)

## `add-picker-option`
Adds a new picker option that will then be shown in the next call to the `pick` command.
- usage: `add-picker-option <name>`

## `quit`

making it the new buffer's associated filepath.
